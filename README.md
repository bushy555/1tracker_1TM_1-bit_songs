# 1tracker_1TM_1-bit_songs
Selection of .1TM songs for Shiru's 1-bit 1Tracker.


1tracker for creating 1-bit music, specifically for the ZX Sprectrum, but the output assembly can be changed to suit any Z80 based computer than can output sound.  At the time of writing, the current version of 1tracker is v0.47

From within 1Tracker, one can export the music as engine source code in assembly with music data attached.  Modify the sound port or latch on your destined computer, fiddle with the timings, assemble and run.
This is what I have used to create & port music for the VZ200/VZ300, Laser 500, Microbee, Aquarius, Camputers Lynx, TRS80 models 1 & 4, Jupiter Ace, ZX81 cassette port and Sam Coupe Z80 computers.

Depending on the engine that is being used, the output assembly sources will have been (mostly) written for either PASMO or SJASMPLUS assemblers; download both for experimentation of these 1-bit music engines.
Majoirty of Shiru's engines are destined for SJASMplus, whilst most of Utz's, Lyndon Sharp, and a few others assemble quite nicely with Pasmo assembler.
