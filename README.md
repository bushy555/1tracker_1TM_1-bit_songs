# 1tracker_1TM_1-bit_songs
Selection of .1TM songs for Shiru's 1-bit 1Tracker.


1tracker for creating 1-bit music, specifically for the ZX Sprectrum, but the output assembly can be changed to suit any Z80 based computer than can output sound.

This is what I have used to create & port music for the VZ200/VZ300, Microbee, Aquarius and Lynx Z80 computers.
Depending on the engine that is being used, the output assembly sources will have been previously written for either PASMO or SJASMPLUS assemblers; download both for experimentation of these 1-bit music engines.
